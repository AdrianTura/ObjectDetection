# ObjectDetection
This repository aims to implement the current SOTA methods in Object Detection.

Currently, only yolo model is implemented. Next step is to update this implementation, and add SSD model. Another direction is to add more datasets.

Week 1: Created the repository.
Week 2: Performed training experiments on yolo network.
Week 3: Continued with yolo experiments, and imported a new repository with ssd.
Week 4: Applied for computing resources at work, and adapted the ssd for this infrastructure.
Week 5:
